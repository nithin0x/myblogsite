## Cyber Security Analyst

**TiQHUB** â€¢ Full-time â€¢ Oct 2023 - Present  
*Ashburn, Virginia, United States Â· Remote*

As a digital problem-solver, I look at a company's technology - all its apps, cloud services, and devices - and figure out the best ways to keep it safe from threats. I enjoy the challenge of making complex systems secure and helping people feel confident in the technology they use every day.

-   **Finding Weak Spots:** I proactively identify security risks through **penetration testing** and vulnerability assessments across cloud, network, OSINT, web, and AI platforms, using tools like Maester and Microsoft Vulnerability Management.
-   **Securing Systems:** I harden systems and applications by implementing robust security configurations based on trusted industry guides from **CIS, CISA, STIG, and Microsoft**.
-   **Meeting Standards:** I collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure our security practices meet important **compliance frameworks** like CMMC and NIST 800-*.
-   **Helping People:** I enjoy training teams on how to manage their security settings and spot potential threats, making security straightforward and accessible for everyone.
